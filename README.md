# Milestone Project 1 - North Wales Drum School

## Purpose

For this project I intend to design a static website for a fictional drum teacher or school. This site will be constructed using knowledge gained so far on the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design Modules.

The live website can be found here. (link)

# North Wales Drum School Website.

The North Wales Drum School website is a site for a fictional or hypothetical Drumming School business. This project is based on and inspired by my 8 year old daughter taking up the drums just over 1 year ago.

This site will be a fully responsive website that will advertise the School, along with being a source of information that is easy to digest and understand for consumers both young and old.


<br />

# User Experience Design

### First Time Visitor Goals

- As a first time user I need to easily navigate through the site and find the information that I need.
- As a first time user I need to be able to view the website clearly on both tablet and mobile, as well as desktop.
- As a first time user I need to be able to easily find contact details to book lessons and also find social media links to follow the school.


### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a returning visitor I want to be able to look at the gallery to view images of concerts, and videos of performances etc.
- As a returning visitor I want to be able to sign up to the email newsletter to be kept up to date with any lesson changes or Gallery updates.

# Design

## Colour Scheme

The colours I intend to use for the site are Blue (#036ffc) and black (#000000).
The blue will represent a feeling of trust and stability and will compliment the boldness of the black well.

<br />

# Typography

The logo will be made up of an svg file rather than a typeface. This logo will be link to the main header.

- Inter (including all font weights)
A sans-serif font with easy readability for the paragraph text.

<br />

# Structure

The pages will contain the same fixed navigation bar at the top of the page to convey a sense of continuity. This navigation menu will allow users to move through the site easily, directing the user to a new section. The Nav bar will be collapsable on a mobile advice.

<br />

# Landing page layout

The main page header will consist of a large eye catching image which will grab the users attention straioght away,
showing exactly what the site is about. 
<br />
There will be an added form on the landing page which the visitor to the site will immediately see, which will offer a free taster lesson. This will be followed by an about us section, which will consist of details about the drum school plus a section with technical details about the percussion instruments in the studio.
<br />
There will be a testimonial section, giving reviews of past and current users of the school. 
<br />
There will also be a gallery section which will show pictures of the studio, plus some live pictures and video of recent
concerts put on by the studio. Lastly, there will be the footer section which will consist of the contact details, a map and the social media icons.
