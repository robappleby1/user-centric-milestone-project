# Milestone Project 1

## Purpose

For this project I intend to design a static website for a fictional drum teacher or school. This site will be constructed using knowledge gained so far on the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design Modules.

The live website can be found here. (link)

## North Wales Drum School Website.

The North Wales Drum School website is a site for a fictional or hypothetical Drumming School business. This project is based on and inspired by my 8 year old daughter taking up the drums about 1 year ago.

This site will be a fully responsive website that will advertise the School, along with being a source of information that is easy to digest and understand for consumers both young and old.
