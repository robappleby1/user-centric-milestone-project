# Milestone Project 1

## Purpose

For this project I intend to design a static website for a fictional drum teacher or school. This site will be constructed using knowledge gained so far on the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design Modules.

The live website can be found here. (link)



# North Wales Drum School Website.

The North Wales Drum School website is a site for a fictional or hypothetical Drumming School business. This project is based on and inspired by my 8 year old daughter taking up the drums just over 1 year ago.

This site will be a fully responsive website that will advertise the School, along with being a source of information that is easy to digest and understand for consumers both young and old.


# User Experience Design

### First Time Visitor Goals

- As a first time user I need to easily navigate through the site and find the information that I need.
- As a first time user I need to be able to view the website clearly on both tablet and mobile, as well as desktop.
- As a first time user I need to be able to easily find contact details to book lessons and also find social media links to follow the school.


### Returning Visitor Goals

- As a returning visitor I want to be able to look at the gallery to view images of concerts, and videos of performances etc.
- As a returning visitor I want to be able to sign up to the email newsletter to be kept up to date with any lesson changes or Gallery updates.


# Structure

The pages will all contain the same fixed navigation bar at the top of the page to convey a sense of continuity. This navigation menu will allow users to move through the site easily, directing the user to a new page. The Nav bar will be collapsable on a mobile advice.
